/**
 * <p>
 * A lock that is acquired and unlocked asynchronously. An instance of this lock
 * is used to guard access to the Oracle JDBC Connection, without blocking
 * threads that contend for it.
 * </p><p>
 * Any time Oracle R2DBC invokes a synchronous API of Oracle JDBC, it will
 * acquire an instance of this lock before doing so. Synchronous method calls
 * will block a thread if JDBC has a database call in progress, and this can
 * lead a starvation of the thread pool. If no pooled threads are available,
 * then JDBC can not execute callbacks that complete the database call, and
 * so JDBC will never release it's blocking lock.
 * </p><p>
 * Any time Oracle R2DBC creates a publisher that is implemented by the
 * Oracle JDBC driver, it will acquire an instance of this lock before
 * subscribing to that publisher. The lock is only released if it is known
 * that neither onNext nor onSubscribe signals are pending. If these signals
 * are not pending, then the driver should not be executing any database
 * call; As long as no database call is in progress, JDBC should not block
 * threads that call any method of its API.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Locking for Asynchronous JDBC Calls</h3>
 * <p>
 * Wrapping a JDBC Publisher with {@link #lock(Publisher)} will have signals
 * from a downstream subscriber proxied, such that the lock is held whenever
 * {@code onSubscribe} or {@code onNext} signals are pending.
 * </p><p>
 * Invoking {@link #lock(Runnable)} will have a {@code Runnable} executed
 * after the lock becomes available. The {@code Runnable} is executed
 * immediately, before {@code lock(Runnable)} returns if the lock is
 * available. Otherwise, the {@code Runnable} is executed asynchronously
 * after the lock becomes available.
 * </p><p>
 * The {@code Runnable} provided to {@link #lock(Runnable)} <i>MUST</i> ensure
 * that a single invocation of {@link #unlock()} will occur after its
 * {@code run()} method is invoked. The call to {@code unlock} may occur
 * within the scope of the {@code Runnable.run()} method. It may also occur
 * asynchronously, after the {@code run()} method has returned.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Locking for Synchronous JDBC Calls</h3>
 * <p>
 * If the lock simply needs to be acquired before making a synchronous call,
 * and then released after that call returns, then methods
 * {@link #run(JdbcRunnable)}, {@link #get(JdbcSupplier)}, or
 * {@link #flatMap(JdbcSupplier)} may be used. These methods return a
 * {@code Publisher} that completes after the lock is acquired and the provided
 * task has been run. These methods will automatically release the lock after
 * the provided task has run.
 * </p><p>
 * Rather than invoke the {@code get/run} methods for each and every JDBC
 * method call, it is preferable to invoke them with a single task that
 * performs many synchronous JDBC API calls. This will reduce the computational
 * and memory costs of creating and subscribing to publishers. It will also
 * allow most of the code base to be written in a synchronous style, with the
 * assumption that it is executing within a task provided to the {@code get/run}
 * methods.
 * </p>

   * </p>
   *
   * <h3>Problem Overview</h3>
   * <p>
   * {@code UsingConnectionSubscriber} solves a problem with how Oracle JDBC
   * implements thread safety. When an asynchronous database call is initiated
   * with a {@code Connection}, that {@code Connection} is locked until
   * the call completes. When a {@code Connection} is locked, any thread that
   * invokes a method of that {@code Connection} or any object created by that
   * {@code Connection} will become blocked. This can lead to a deadlock where
   * all threads in a pool have become blocked until the database call
   * completes, and JDBC can not complete the database call until a thread
   * becomes unblocked.
   * </p><p>
   * As a simplified example, consider what would happen with the code below if
   * the Executor had a pool of 1 thread:
   * </p><pre>
   * List<Flow.Publisher<Boolean>> publishers = new ArrayList<>();
   * executor.execute(() -> {
   *   try {
   *     publishers.add(connection.prepareStatement("SELECT 0 FROM dual")
   *       .unwrap(OraclePreparedStatement.class)
   *       .executeAsyncOracle());
   *
   *     publishers.add(connection.prepareStatement("SELECT 1 FROM dual")
   *       .unwrap(OraclePreparedStatement.class)
   *       .executeAsyncOracle());
   *   }
   *   catch (SQLException sqlException) {
   *     sqlException.printStackTrace();
   *   }
   * });
   * </pre><p>
   * After the first call to {@code executeAsyncOracle}, the connection is
   * locked, and so when the second call to {@code executeAsyncOracle} is
   * made, the executor thread is blocked. If Oracle JDBC is configured to use
   * this same executor, which has a pool of just one thread, then no thread
   * is left to handle the response from the database for the first call to
   * {@code executeAsyncOracle}. With no thread available to handle the
   * response, the call is never completed and the connection is never
   * unlocked, so the code above results in a deadlock.
   * </p><p>
   * While the code above presents a somewhat obvious scenario, it is more
   * common for deadlocks to occur in less obvious ways. Consider this code
   * example which uses Project Reactor and R2DBC:
   * </p><pre>
   * Flux.usingWhen(
   *   connectionFactory.create(),
   *   connection ->
   *     Flux.usingWhen(
   *       Mono.from(connection.beginTransaction())
   *         .thenReturn(connection),
   *       connection ->
   *         connection.createStatement("INSERT INTO deadlock VALUES(?)")
   *           .bind(0, 0)
   *           .execute(),
   *       Connection::commitTransaction),
   *   Connection::close)
   *   .hasElements();
   * </pre><p>
   * The hasElements() operator transforms the sequence into a single boolean
   * value. When an {@code onNext} signal delivers this value, the subscriber
   * emits a {@code cancel} signal to the upstream publisher as the
   * subscriber does not require any additional values. This cancel signal
   * triggers a subscription to both the commitTransaction() publisher and to
   * the close() publisher. The commitTransaction() publisher subscribed to
   * first, and this has the Oracle JDBC connection locked until that
   * database call completes. The close() publisher is subscribed to immediately
   * afterwards, and this has the thread become blocked. As there is no
   * thread left to handle the result of the commit, the connection never
   * becomes unlocked.
   * </p>
   *
   * <h3>Guarding Access to the JDBC Connection</h3>
   * <p>
   * Access to the JDBC Connection must be guarded such that no thread will
   * attempt to use it when an asynchronous database call is in-flight. The
   * potential for an in-flight call exists whenever there is a pending signal
   * from the upstream {@code Publisher}. Instances of
   * {@code UsingConnectionSubscriber} acquire this {@link AsyncLock}
   * before requesting a signal from the publisher, and release the
   * {@code asyncLock} once that signal is received. This ensures that no other
   * thread will be able to acquire the {@code asyncLock} when a pending signal
   * is potentially pending upon an asynchronous database call.
   * </p><p>
   * An {@code onSubscribe} signal is pending between an invocation of
   * {@link Publisher#subscribe(Subscriber)} and an invocation of
   * {@link Subscriber#onSubscribe(Subscription)}. Accordingly, the
   * {@link AsyncLock} <i>MUST</i> be acquired before invoking
   * {@code subscribe} with an instance of {@code UsingConnectionSubscriber}.
   * When that instance receives an {@code onSubscribe} signal, it will release
   * the {@code asyncLock}.
   * </p><p>
   * An {@code onNext} signal is pending between an invocation of
   * {@link Subscription#request(long)} and a number of invocations of
   * {@link Subscriber#onNext(Object)} equal to the number of
   * values requested. Accordingly, instances of
   * {@code UsingConnectionSubscriber} acquire the {@link AsyncLock} before
   * emitting a {@code request} signal, and release the {@code asyncLock} when
   * a corresponding number of {@code onNext} signals have been received.
   * </p><p>
   * When a {@code cancel} signal is emitted to the upstream {@code Publisher},
   * that publisher will not emit any further signals to the downstream
   * {@code Subscriber}. If an instance {@code UsingConnectionSubscriber}
   * has acquired the {@link AsyncLock} for a pending {@code onNext} signal,
   * then it will defer sending a {@code cancel} signal until the pending
   * {@code onNext} signal has been received. Deferring cancellation until the
   * the publisher invokes {@code onNext} ensures that the cancellation happens
   * after any pending database call, and before any subsequent database calls
   * that would obtain additional values for {@code onNext}.
